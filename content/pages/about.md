## I'm Lionel Garcia

PhD student in astronomy at the [University of Liège](https://www.uliege.be) under the supervision of [*Michaël Gillon*](https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_9054334/fr/repertoire?uid=u193465) and within the [SPECULOOS](https://www.speculoos.uliege.be) and TRAPPIST projects/consortia.

The ultimate goal of my research is to contribute to the **first detailed atmospheric characterization of a terrestrial exoplanet**. While telescopes are steadily growing in size & sensitivity, I am particularly interested in those instrument-agnostic challenges that will limit our understanding if left unsolved:
- The **detection of terrestrial planets** around active stars
- The development of **reproducible light-curves reduction** and analysis tools
- A better **understanding of ultra-cool dwarf stars** active regions

As part of my work I am exploiting data from both space and ground-based telescopes. I am also taking part to the maintenance of the SPECULOOS telescopes located in [Paranal (Chile)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranal_Observatory) and [Tenerife (Canary Islands)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teide_Observatory).

## Ideas

I am currently interested in two separate ideas:
- The robust and full-fledged detection of exoplanet transits in light-curves featuring all kind of red noises (incl. stellar variability) and transit-timing variations
- The use of neural network for robust and fast PSF photometry and analysis
