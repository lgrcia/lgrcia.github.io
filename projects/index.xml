Depending on the noise characteristics, we show that the traditional technique that consists of detrending a light curve before searching for transits alters their signal-to-noise ratio, and hinders our capability to discover exoplanets transiting rapidly-rotating active stars. We present &lt;em>nuance&lt;/em>, an algorithm to search for transits in light curves while simultaneously accounting for the presence of correlated noise, such as stellar variability and instrumental signals. We assess the performance of &lt;em>nuance&lt;/em> on simulated light curves as well as on the TESS light curves of 438 rapidly-rotating M dwarfs. For each dataset, we compare our method to 5 commonly-used detrending techniques followed by a search with the Box-Least-Square algorithm. Overall, we demonstrate that &lt;em>nuance&lt;/em> is the most performant method in 93% of cases, leading to both the highest number of true positives and the lowest number of false positive detections. Although simultaneously searching for transits while modeling correlated noise is expected to be computationally expensive, we make our algorithm tractable and availa ble as the JAX-powered Python package &lt;em>nuance&lt;/em>, allowing its use on distributed environments and GPU devices. Finally, we explore the prospects offered by the &lt;em>nuance&lt;/em> formalism, and its use to advance our knowledge of planetary systems around active stars, both using space-based surveys and sparse ground-based observations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>portal</title><link>https://lgrcia.github.io/projects/portal/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lgrcia.github.io/projects/portal/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.speculoos.uliege.be">SPECULOOS survey&lt;/a> generates approx. 70TB of raw images per night, thanks to its 8 robotic telescopes located around the globe. Once these data transferred, its &lt;a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.2446M/abstract">automatic reduction pipeline&lt;/a> produces daily light curves that need to be inspected and analyzed by a large consortium. To ease this collaborative process, &lt;a href="https://github.com/ppp-one">Peter Pihlmann Pedersen&lt;/a> (University of Cambridge, back-end) and I (front-end) developed a web-based interface, allowing our teams to visualize various data products, as well as reporting any signal of interest to the rest of the consortium (see features below).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The frontend of the web-based interface is built using &lt;a href="https://vuejs.org">VueJS&lt;/a>, with a backend following the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP model&lt;/a>. Visualizations are built using the &lt;a href="https://plotly.com">plotly&lt;/a> library.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>prose</title><link>https://lgrcia.github.io/projects/prose/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lgrcia.github.io/projects/prose/</guid><description>&lt;p>In Astronomy, a large number of observations lead to 2D images, often recorded in time. Either dealing with raw images or processed products, scientists must generally employ or trust &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)">pipelines&lt;/a>: a set of processing units sequentially executed on each image before being combined into exploitable datasets: photometric or spectroscopic light curves, spatial profiles, transients detection… and so on. Given their complexity and size, pipelines can be challenging to understand, document and maintain. This is particularly true for pipelines dedicated to medium-size instruments, developed by scientists (not engineers) as monoliths, with hardcoded settings and poor documentation. In opposition, pipelines from larger-budget instruments benefit from proper engineering teams, putting effort into maintaining tools for the scientific community (as does &lt;a href="https://www.eso.org/public/">ESO&lt;/a> for example).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For building cryptic monoliths, no one is to blame. Scientists often lack the time and expertise to build such softwares, and legitimately prefer spending energy on the methods they develop and the science they study. prose is a Python package allowing scientists to build robust, modular and transparent pipelines, focusing on what matters. By providing a set of pre-implemented (documented) blocks, one can easily assemble and test processing sequences, and only develop the blocks they need. Not only this approach yield reproducible tools, it allows for rapid iteration towards pipelines with optimal scientific products.&lt;/p>

We observed three transits of its outermost planet, TRAPPIST-1h, using the G141 grism of the Wide Field Camera 3 instrument aboard the Hubble Space Telescope to place constraints on its potentially cold atmosphere. In order to deal with the effect of stellar contamination, we model TRAPPIST-1 active regions as portions of a cooler and a hotter photosphere, and generate multi-temperature models that we compare to the out-of-transit spectrum of the star. Using the inferred spot parameters, we produce corrected transmission spectra for planet h under five transit configurations and compare these data to planetary atmospheric transmission models using the forward model CHIMERA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our analysis reveals that TRAPPIST-1h is unlikely to host an aerosol-free H/He-dominated atmosphere. While the current data precision limits the constraints we can put on the planetary atmosphere, we find that the likeliest scenario is that of a flat, featureless transmission spectrum in the WFC3/G141 bandpass due to a high mean molecular weight atmosphere (≥1000 × solar), no atmosphere, or an opaque aerosol layer, all in absence of stellar contamination. This work outlines the limitations of modeling active photospheric regions with theoretical stellar spectra, and those brought by our lack of knowledge of the photospheric structure of ultracool dwarf stars. Further characterization of the planetary atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1h would require higher precision measurements over wider wavelengths, which will be possible with the James Webb Space Telescope.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Polar</title><link>https://lgrcia.github.io/projects/polar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://lgrcia.github.io/projects/polar/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
